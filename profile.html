        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
        Hi, my name is Alhasan Mohsen, and I recently graduated from Kennesaw State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (May 2025). During my time at KSU, I took on a leadership role as president of AI@KSU, where I helped organize workshops and collaborative projects that gave students hands-on exposure to developing basic AI technologies. I also partnered with Cox Communications, where I led a project to build a security lookup interface toolâ€”my first opportunity to step into a leadership role and demonstrate my ability to guide a team, split workloads, and communicate effectively to meet deadlines. These experiences shaped me into a strong problem-solver, presenter, and team player who thrives in collaborative environments.

          During my time with AI@KSU, I was actively involved in creating innovative products and services that utilized machine learning through pattern recognition and reinforcement learning.
          We also designed a lightweight object detection model for tracking bees' movements.
          Finally, I initiated a project to develop a Kennesaw State University Advising Chatbot to assist students and advisors in making educational decisions.
